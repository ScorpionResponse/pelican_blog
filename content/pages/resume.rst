My Resume
#########

I spent 5 years as a Product Manager creating an brand new application which
helped the users of a library access electronic resources.

Presently I do Python freelance development of all sorts, but primarily this
means web development with Django.  My github account is linked in the footer.
I am always happy to discuss with new clients what they might want.  Feel free
to email me (address in the footer).

I also like to write about various things on this blog and elsewhere.  If you
like my writing, I also will do that for you on a freelance basis.
