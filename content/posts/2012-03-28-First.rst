Time has come for me to crawl out from the rock I'm under and join the
early 2000's.  I generally try to keep a low profile on the internet, but
lately I've started to feel as if I should participate a little more in
my interests.

This site will mostly be a dumping ground for the random throughts I have and
projects that I work on. So far I haven't found a great way to keep track of
the things that I might want to refer to again.  Hopefully this will work and
no one else will ever find it.

The blog is powered by `Pelican <http://pelican.notmyidea.org/>`_.  So far, I
have found it fairly easy to get set up.  If I run into any snags, this'll be
the place I put them.

Here's to trying new things.
