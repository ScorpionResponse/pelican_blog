So dawns a new age.  In this age, strategy and forethought are gone.  The
merest hint of consistency is evidenced only by an undercurrent of xenophobia.
This is the world we now live in.  This is the Age of Trump.  Welcome to
Reality Politics.

Reality Politics is politics in the same way that a Reality television show is
a normal television show.  Sure, Americans at least have gotten used to the
idea of cameras just sort of haphazardly following around bombastic celebrities
or a bunch of yahoos trapped in a house, but there is often no coherent
narrative or purpose to these shows.  They may be entertaining, but ultimately
the purpose is for a television network to spend the minimum amount of money
necessary to get you to tune in and generate revenue for them.  

And so it is with Reality Politics.  It is concerned only with doing the
profitable things.  It wants you to tune in and watch the spectacle.  It wants
you to choose a side and cheer.  What it does not want and cannot hold up to is
your critical thought.  If you stop and think about any policy in particular,
you would see the obvious flaws and pointless conflict.  Here are a handful in
no particular order:

* Fantastically amazing job growth promises: Here's a key part of getting folks
  on board with the idea.  They want better jobs.  That is probably universally
  true in a good economy or a bad one.  Everyone thinks things could be better
  and, evidently, a lot of people believe that things *used* to be better.  But
  a lot of the jobs (coal miner, for instance) are not going to come back.
  There is an obvious way to generate more demand for goods and services, which
  is to have more people.  To have more people, you could have catastrophically
  idiotic laws about contraception and abortion, or you could support sensible
  pro-immigration policies.
* Immigration: The solution, somehow to some set of problems is to build a
  giant, fucking wall between the US and Mexico and "Mexico will pay for it."
  Only the most gullible will believe that Mexico will pay for this wall.  So of
  course it will hurt US citizens.  Also given that it is a needlessly hateful
  act, it also serves to discourage immigration.  This wall is nothing more
  than a giant, monstrously expensive "Keep Out" sign.  As a policy it is
  idiotic, but as a reality politics plotline it is eminently watchable.  
* Pointless off-hand war mongering: Trump apparently has no problem dropping
  hints or suggestions that, if enacted, would lead to catastrophic wars.  This
  can be seen in his comment about nuclear weapons ["Let it be an arms
  race"](http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump-on-nukes-let-it-be-an-arms-race-840234051934)
  or on his challenging of the "One China" policy or his flippant suggestion
  that perhaps we should re-invade Iraq to ["take the
  oil."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/09/trump-thinks-the-u-s-should-take-the-oil-in-iraq-heres-why-that-is-not-so-easy/)
  Critically, all of these things, if they should come to pass are gross
  violations of international norms and insanely dangerous ideas that no
  one in their right mind could possibly want.  These things all bring us
  closer to war with the only obvious upside being that we keep paying
  attention to Trump.

The list, of course, goes on.  We are at the end of the first full week of
Trump's presidency and this nonsense is a thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride of
horrors.  For anyone sane who is watching this, the whole debacle is abjectly
terrifying.

Lots of people are mobilizing.  And mobilize we should.  Call Congresspeople or
Senators.  Call everyone to get your voices heard for the side of sanity.  At
the very least hopefully we can keep the country going in something like a
sensible direction while this whole thing unfolds.  But what I'm afraid of is
that the only way for Reality Politics to stop will be if we stop watching.
And the death throes may be catastrophic.  If we stop giving Trump the
attention he pathologically requires, he may stoop to ever more destructive
actions to get our attention.

There is no clear way to turn this into a positive.  Perhaps a more politically
engaged populace is the upside.  Perhaps that means we will have the smart
minds and the right people in politics in the future to correct some of these
horrors.  But make no mistake, in the meanwhile people will die because of this
folly.  And America's reputation around the globe will diminish because we let
this happen.  We, in fact, voted to make this happen.  Maybe our reputation
*should* diminish.  Regardless of the long term outcome of this, the next 4
years are going to be one continuous screaming nightmare.
