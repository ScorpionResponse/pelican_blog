We are the last generation of humanity.  We cast this message to the stars with
the sincere hope that any other living being in the universe will hear it and
will be spared from the mistakes we made.  Please do not follow us to oblivion.
Don't try to save us.  Just listen to our message.  Please listen.

We are the last generation of humanity.  Some time in the next 30 years our
population will be reduced below the minimum number for our species to continue
to exist.  We will eventually all die off and the era of intelligent life on
our planet will be over.  We are unable to reverse the downward trend of our
population.  You must not become us.

We are the last generation of humanity.  We almost didn't notice.  It wasn't a
cataclysm or a war that ended us.  The means of our end were so insidious that
we didn't see it coming until it was too late.  You must be vigilant.

We are the last generation of humanity.  We died for spite.  We died out of
distrust and hate.  We died because we didn't agree what the problem was.  We
all thought the other side was lying about what was happening and we decided to
just dream up a lot of problems to blame them for.  We blamed people for loving
each other.  We blamed people who said we should forgive each other.  We blamed
people who were just trying to live their lives.  We blamed people who tried to
help us fix the real problems.  You must love each other.

We are the last generation of humanity.  Everyone believed the other side, the
idiots, were 'winning' and that their idiotic ideas would inherit the earth
because there were going to be more of them eventually.  We didn't want to
bring our children into a world where 'our kind' were in such short supply.
And so we all struggled.  We struggled against each other and the future and
the past.  We struggled to be first.  We struggled to be The One who made a
billion dollars.  We knew that *we* were the only one who deserved it.  You
must respect each other.

We are the last generation of humanity.  Because we didn't want to share.  The
rich wanted more riches.  The people with new ideas wanted to keep them secret
because their ideas were too good to share.  The people with food wanted to
keep it stockpiled for themselves because their food would save them from the
rest of us.  Everyone kept whatever meager resources they could grab onto for
themselves.  They didn't share with anyone.  You must help each other.

We are the last generation of humanity.  No one could be trusted.  Men thought
women wanted to be freeloaders off of the sweat of their brow.  Women thought men
wanted only to use them as baby-making factories.  Everyone wanted to steal what
you had.  No one would give you as much as you deserved in return.  They were
just trying to get one over on you.  That's how they get you.  You must trust
each other.

We are the last generation of humanity.  We let our mothers die in childbirth
because they didn't have the money to have medical help having a baby and their
bodies could no longer safely bear a child without medial assistance.  The
babies who were born often died because there was no money for medicine and
because the ones who could afford medicine believed it was designed to make
their babies sick.  Everyone believed the other side was having all of the
babies.  That they would be the ones who would 'win.'  You must take care of
each other.

We are the last generation of humanity.  The scientists have been trying to
warn us for years.  No one believed them because science was the one religion
that never told you what was True but just what they believed right now.  Why
would anyone listen to someone who might change their mind at some later point
when they got more information?  We listened to the Truth, unchanging and
forever True.  You must value knowledge.

We are the last generation of humanity.  We have made great works.  We have
made monuments to our greatness.  We have buildings that pierce the sky.  We
have countless statues to remind us of how selfless we are.  We had beautiful
music designed to console us when other people hurt us.  We have art that means
something special and different, personal to each person that views it.  None
of those beautiful, wonderful things will survive.  None of those accompanies
this message.  They will all be forgotten.  They are the price we pay to tell you
this message.  They are the price we pay so that you can hear our warning.  You
must listen.

We are the last generation of humanity.  Now our entire existence serves only
as a warning to others who may be out there receiving this message.  Maybe it
was for the best.  You must not become us.  

You must live.

**Artifact**: Last words of "humanity"

**Description**: This message was found etched on a golden disc recovered from a
ship floating in space by the Collective of Argus.  Their message was
translated by the work of a scholarly enclave devoted to its study for 5 turns.

**Interpretation**: The tone of the message suggests that "humanity" never knew any
Collective other than their own.  Although the message does not state this, it
is generally believed that the "humanity" society all died before developing
an understanding of basic common sense which everyone in the Collective knows
was one of the earliest traits used by our pre-collectives who first crawled
out of the ground and into the light.  They seem to think that other
collectives could suffer from their own deformities, which is quite abundantly
impossible by our own example.  It is unclear why they believe that their
abject failure to survive as a species earns them the privilege of issuing the
commands included in their message, but scholars have theorized that this
self-contradiction is inherent in their species and was likely a principle
factor in their downfall.  Our collective structure prevents such
self-delusions, so their words simply do not apply.

**Recommendation**: Ship this artifact over to the Mound.  *They* will probably
benefit from the message more than we would.  Maybe they'll learn to live in a
proper collective instead of in their unworkable *'community'* debacle before the
fools all die off too.  Perhaps seeing the remnants of a collective from a
different world will finally make them look up from the dirt and think about
the future instead of just building more birthing hives.
