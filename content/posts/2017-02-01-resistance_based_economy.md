A new dawn shined brightly through my skylight.  The sun crept across my face
and slowly roused me from my dreams.  I was having another one where Marcus and
I were in the center of a protective circle declaring our love for one another.
I can barely contain my excitement for the wedding even though it is still
months away.  I gingerly uncoiled the covers and crept out of the bed, trying
not to wake Marcus who was snoozing away.

I busied myself with my morning routine.  First some meditation, then my
vitamins, then a few minutes drinking my morning juice while catching up on the
news.  I sat at the kitchen table and popped up **ResistR** to get updates on the
progress of protests yesterday and any new issues that we'll have to deal with
today.  It looked like yesterday's airport protests went well.  People seemed
to have turned up at all of the international airports and a handful of local
only airports in symbolic solidarity.  A few pictures of children of various
faiths holding protest signs and chatting together in the crowd have gone
viral.  A few reports of pepper spray being deployed and some pictures of
little children in handcuffs for some idiotic goddamn reason, but no deaths or
serious violence.  All in all it was a good day of protests.  We were getting
our message out.

And now, the most dreaded part.  Finding out what fresh hell the government
decided was going to be today's issue to protest was always a roller coaster
ride.  Would it be a standard statehouse protest or would we have to change-up
the location today?  Would we need to make custom signs or would the normal
ones do?  

A jolt of annoyance shot through me as I remembered last Tuesday's ban on
Muslims serving food to Christians.  I had planned to go to a new kind of yoga
class that morning where they would read out passages from a book of meditative
ideas while we were practicing.  The classes were always packed and I had to
sign up a month in advance.  But, of course, we didn't have a sign ready for
the right to serve food to Christians.  Who even thinks of that kind of
nonsense?  The government was getting so many crazy, new ideas lately we had
run out of poster board too.  So instead of going to my yoga class that I had
been looking forward to all month, I had to go stop by the **PRO-test** store to
pick up some more poster board and make new signs in time for the march.  Sigh.

I tapped the 'Unite Today' button to see what the plan was.  Thankfully the
government spent all day yesterday trying to explain why the 8 year old in
handcuffs was a threat to national security and they didn't get around to
unleashing whatever hateful crackdown on human decency they had planned, so it
was just going to be a normal statehouse protest with the usual signs.  Maybe
today we'll go with something more fun and less issue specific.  I always liked
"OH HELL NO" for a fun one.  Sometimes you have to bring out "I AM QUITE UPSET"
or "STOP KILLING PEOPLE YOU FUCKING TWATS" but maybe not today.  Today, I think
I'll wear my green and black yoga pants and that goes well with the colors of
OH HELL NO, so that seems like a good choice.

By the time I was done with my morning routine, Marcus was finally up.  I got a
groggy hug and an offhand "How'd you sleep?" before I got out the door.  I
stopped by my local coffee shop and got my #Resistance discount on a
Caf&eacute; Mocha.  The line was shorter than usual.  I guess some folks
decided to take the day off since there wasn't anything new to protest.  Maybe
I'll take it easy today too.  I took out my phone with the raised fist in black
and red case that went perfectly with this new beret I got and hit the button
for a **LibreRider** to come pick me up.  Usually it was hard to find any drivers
on the non-evil taxi app, but sometimes when it was slow like this you could
snag one.  And I was in luck too, only 4 minutes away.

The driver took me all the way down to the statehouse.  It looked like a few
early birds (or overnighters, it was hard to tell) were already out marching
and chanting with the usual signs, but there would still be plenty of time
before it picked up for real.  I felt like I had enough time to slip in to
**MOVEment** across the street for a wake-up yoga class.  It was just a beginner
class, but Mary was teaching it and she always knows how to get the right
energy for protesting flowing through my body.

After my class, I was raring to go.  The crowd outside the statehouse had
reached a respectable size.  I saw Marcus walking around with a "NO WAR FOR
OIL" sign and snuck up behind him.  I grabbed his butt and yelled "Gotcha!" to
surprise him.  He was excited this morning too, so I gave him a big kiss and we
both fell in line together.  This morning was a hearty round of "Show me what
democracy looks like! / This is what democracy looks like!"  I held Marcus'
hand tightly as we marched and yelled.  I still couldn't believe I found a man
I loved enough to marry, but I guess I'm just lucky.  Today was going to be a
good day.
