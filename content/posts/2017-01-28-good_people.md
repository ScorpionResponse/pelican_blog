There is a topic that has been coming up a lot recently.  Specifically, this:

I have seen this same sentiment expressed also as this concept:

That we are at some kind of inflection point in history where everything will
start to go directly to shit is not something that I'm questioning.  What I am
questioning is that I am somehow responsible for this.  I'm a coward.  I didn't
fucking vote for this asshole.  I am abjectly terrified.  I have no idea what
to do and when I evaluate any of the options which seem open to me none of them
seem like they would actually fix anything.  Also many of the options seem like
they might, you know, get my name on a list.

Frankly, it is hard enough trying to do anything but flee the country at this
point.  I might wind up doing exactly that.  But, for now, I guess even we
cowards have to do something.  I went to a protest yesterday.  I will go to
another one.  To be perfectly honest, I don't know if I'm doing the right
things.  I don't know if this helps.  But I'm too terrified to sit still.
