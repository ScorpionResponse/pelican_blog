**Spoilers for the Season 1 finale of The OA follow.  Be warned.**

By now, the internet buzz around the newly released and widely binged Netflix
series The OA has quieted down.   A fair number of articles are out there
discussing details of the ending, things you may have missed, and
interpretations of what folks think is happening.  Most of those that I've seen
include some commentary about whether the events of the finale were in some way
in bad taste.  Specifically in question is the use of a school shooting to
imperil the group of friends and fulfill The OA's dream premonitions.  The
Washington Post, for instance, calls this ["shocking tastelessness."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/12/21/the-ridiculous-ending-of-the-oa-betrays-the-series-best-idea/?utm_term=.101be410dcd5)

The central argument against the use of this type of violence seems to be
that it is somehow crass to use a current problem that we face in America
to further the storyline of a television show.  It feels an odd argument
to say that a show with a storyline primarily revolving around the forced
abduction and imprisonment of 5 people has touched on something which is too
uncomfortable to deal with.  In the very first episode a van carrying a bunch
of young children explodes and falls into a frozen lake out of absolutely
nowhere, attributed only to unseen Russian mobsters.  Why is that act of
violence toward children not also tasteless?  Nevertheless, a school shooting barged
directly onto center stage, promptly shot the titular character, and got people
talking about how "tasteless" it was to have this specific kind of violence
depicted on a show.

Of course, in the light of anything that happens there are folks claiming that
they were offended and other folks claiming the first set of people taking
offense has offended them, ad infinitum.  Everyone *should* be offended, but
offended that this is such a significant part of our lives.  If you are upset
that a school shooting suddenly turned the plot of a show you liked into a
narrative mess, imagine how upsetting it would be if a school shooting suddenly
turned your Social Studies class into a living nightmare.  Take every ounce of
rage and pointless "where'd that come from" hot takes and channel that into a
letter to your congressperson asking for stricter gun laws or better mental
health awareness.  I am not suggesting that you must take the specific actions
I think you should take with regard to addressing this issue.  Do what you
think is right to try to stop school shootings.  If you think that arming
teachers somehow helps that problem, then you're wrong, but go lobby to make
that happen and at least you'll be taking action to solve the actual problem
instead of starting a twitter pitchfork army about a TV show.  If you're unsure
of what to do, donating to a charity that is working on the issue is at least
an easy way to try to help without becoming an expert on the particulars of the
problem.

I don't believe there is any real problem with people being offended, but
I also don't believe that there should be any particular problem with our
entertainment including current events in various plotlines.  I also believe
that if random, pointless violence can suddenly erupt and steal our young
people then this should be represented in shows like The OA.  I will go one
step further and say that allowing these types of acts to be so frequent in our
society means that they should be used more frequently by creators everywhere.
A TV show writer should feel free to include scenes like this, but also T-shirt
sloganeers and internet ad networks should feel free to see if they can use
school shootings to turn a buck or otherwise get this idiocy in front of your
face.  A breezy commercial showing a harried mom picking her kids up after
school and talking about the probiotic benefits of some brand of yogurt you can
eat on the go should have her suddenly hit the deck as a hail of bullets start
smacking into her family minivan just before the "Ask your doctor" narration
kicks in.  Everyone living in America should be periodically reminded that
we have a problem that no other developed country seems to have and we probably
should do something about that.  If it upsets you to see Jamie Lee Curtis shit
her pants because of gunfire instead of just the yogurt, then write your
congressperson about gun laws.  If that joke just upset you then go donate to a
[charity devoted to stopping school violence](http://www.sandyhookpromise.org/).

If you are upset by any of this, you have every right to be.  This whole
subject is horrible, disgusting, and probably preventable given that it doesn't
happen so frequently in any other country in the world.  Just make sure
that whatever you choose to do about that anger you feel is directed at
solving the actual problem and not a TV show that reminds you this problem
exists.  At the very least, please remember to do something productive about
the real problem *first*.

Please feel free to do the same or find your own appropriate charity before you
take to twitter to lambast me for my meta-outrage.
