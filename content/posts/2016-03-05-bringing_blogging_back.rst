Bringing Blogging Back

Well, I guess I knew this would have happened.  The blog died immediately after
I created it.  Probably it will remain that way, but who knows.  

For now, I'm just putting together the update process with new versions of
`Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_ so that I can update the `resume page <{filename}/pages/about.rst>`_.
