Resident Evil Colon The Final Chapter is definitely, mostly a movie.  There are
maybe 10-20 people out there who are going to consider watching this movie but
have not yet made up their minds.  I don't even understand how that is
possible, but I will get to you folks in a minute.  For the other groups...

### People who are almost definitely not going to see this movie ###

You wonderful, productive people are not missing anything at all.  If you are
in this group of people, you are probably an attractive and well-to-do person
about town.  You have better things to do than read this.  Go buy a comically
oversized scarf or take a rock-climbing course, whatever it is you kids do
these days.

The only one, minor piece of information that might sway you to go see this
movie is J Bear.  Yes, THE J Bear is in it:

He says things with his J Bear voice.  None of the dialog is particularly good
except there was one line where he says something about "three bitches" which
made the only other person in the theater I was in laugh out loud.  But if you
need more of the raspy love tones of Iain Glen whispering sweet, sensual
nothings about zombies and driving a tank into your ear, then this movie has
those things.

### People who are pretty sure, yeah most likely going to see this movie ###

You people.  You fucking people.  You're my guys and girls.  You're my
***people***.

This is the sixth movie in a hexalology or hexililogy or whatever the six
version of the word trilogy is.  If you have seen at least 60% of the previous
5 movies then you know you're probably going to see this one.  There is no
point in denying it.  Just go.  It will be a nice time.  Alice, aka Zombie
Multipass, is in it.  Claire Redfield is in it for some reason.  The movie
theater will be mostly empty so you can stretch out and put your jacket on the
chair next to you instead of trying to find a comfortable way to sit on it
without it touching the ground.

Pros:

* The Red Queen at some point says "You're all going to die down here."
* There is a fight in that dope-ass laser hallway from the first movie.
* J Bear (see above)

Cons:

* Something like 5/8ths of this movie is exposition.
* At some point one of the characters said "You're Fired." and I was alarmingly
  confronted with the fact that Donald F-ing Trump is our President now.
* This series has been going downhill from the moment the first movie ended and
  this is the sixth one of them.
* This story is more complicated than your taxes.

I guess I should also say that I saw this in 3D.  I cannot recall any reason
for this movie to have been in 3D at all.  Let's say all that means is you have
to wear Buddy Holly glasses for 100 minutes.

### People who are confusingly not in either of those two groups ###

I know, the world can really grind you down.  Life comes at you fast and all
that.  "They made *six* of those??!?"  Yeah, they did.  Here is the **ONLY**
scenario in which a person who is not sure about seeing this movie should
actually go see this movie.  If this scenario doesn't describe you and you
haven't already made up your mind, then skip it.  The first Resident Evil movie
is probably on Netflix or whatever, just go watch that.

But here we go with the scenario.  Let's say you're in high school and you've
picked video production instead of shop class for an elective class.  Then, you
make friends with the teacher and convince him/her to let you start your own
public access TV show.  And you've got an idea... &lt;drum roll&gt;... You're going
to review movies.  Awesome.  Perfect.  Now your teacher is a real cool
dude/dudette and he/she knows a way to hook you up with free movie passes at
the local ZillionPlex 5D UltraScreen Theatres because you're big time movie
reviewers now.  And you're beyond excited.  You're ecstatic.  You're elated.
So you go to the movies and you see everything.  You're watching movies after
work.  You're going to see a movie after you just saw a movie.  Goddamn butter
is coming out of your pores.  You've seen every last movie the theater has a
listing for including that weird one that is some kind of special event single
showing thing that you didn't really understand.  And the only one you haven't
seen yet is "Resident Evil: The Final Exposition."  There is literally nothing
else and you've got a free movie pass on a lanyard around your neck.  A
*lanyard*.  If this situation, in every single detail, describes you and who
you are right now, then you should go see this movie.

Everyone else: skip it.
