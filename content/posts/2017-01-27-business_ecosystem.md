Dear Diary - 

10 minutes ago I read one of the most inane sentences I've ever come across.
9 minutes and 55 seconds ago, my eyes rolled back so far into my head I
couldn't see anything anymore, I fell out of my desk chair and started writhing
on the ground.  I think I started speaking in tongues.  For a while, yapping
like a dog seemed to bring some relief to my situation.  The more aggressively
I yapped the more the chaos and uncertainty of my tortured existence seemed to
recede.  Yet, the yapping also took me farther away from my humanity.  With
each yap, I could feel myself becoming... other.  After interminable minutes,
my throat went sore and dry and I was left gasping for air on the ground.  I
held onto the carpet as if it were my only connection to objective reality.
Finally I crawled into the bathroom and managed to choke down some water
directly from the sink.  Long minutes passed before full consciousness returned
to me.  Slowly I regained my humanity and began to piece together my brush with
the infinite, unknowable recesses of the human soul and the darkness that
exists in all of us.  I vowed never again to read the "What folks are saying
about us" section of a service directed at marketing people.
